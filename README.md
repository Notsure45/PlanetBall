# Planet Ball 
## Version 0.1.0 BETA
### *A planetary golf-like game built on LÃ–VE 0.10.2*

Comments in the code attempt to explain any functions. Contact for clarification/updating comments.

#### OVERVIEW:
A golf game. A player must combine all 'balls' on screen in order to win.
Balls are naturally attracted to eachother, and may start orbits around eachother.
Players can click/touch on the screen to create gravity wells to which the balls are attracted to.
Lower time spent using/creating these wells will result in a higher score.

##### IMPORTANT UDPATE:
When menus are introduced, the game will oficially go into beta! exciting stuff!
##### IMPORTANT TODO:
- [x] Objective Ball System
- [x] Collision System
- [x] Gravity
- [x] Levels
- [ ] Level select
- [ ] Level Designer
- [x] Menus
- [ ] More Content :exclamation:
- [ ] Songs :exclemation:
- [ ] Some good design
##### SLIGHTLY LESS IMPORTANT TODO:
- [x] graphics
- [x] Rudimentary GUI
- [x] Fix screen burn
- [ ] Touch up ball makeup, maybe add an outline
- [ ] Powerups?
#### SPECIFICS:
Balls have their own:
* Color
* Mass
* Radius
* Position
* Velocity
* Acceleration
	
A player can create an invisible 'ball' upon interaction with the game.
It has no color, velocity, acceleration, or radius, and has a constant mass; This is to encourage planning of the use of one's clicking.
Think of it like an interactor, balls come towards your mouse
	
Powerups [Ideas]:
* Mass-of-Click upgrade/downgrade	
* Speedup/Slowdown for individual balls
* 'God Mode': allows for the immediate stop of any ball upon click/interaction
