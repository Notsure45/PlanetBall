# Planet Ball 
## Version 0.3.0 BETA-DEMO
### *A planetary golf-like game built on LÃ–VE 0.10.2*

Comments in the code attempt to explain any functions. Contact for clarification/updating comments.

#### OVERVIEW:
A golf game. A player must combine all 'balls' on screen in order to win.
Balls are naturally attracted to each other, and may start orbits around each other.
Players can click/touch on the screen to create gravity wells to which the balls are attracted to.
Lower time spent using/creating these wells will result in a higher score.
